### Exceeds Spec

#### The Student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review.

#### The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request.

I feel that the feedback I provided was detailed and concrete, which clearly communicated specific needs to get aspects of my peer's project to meet and exceed spec. This included the peer-assessment and the issues I created on Github. Also, I assisted the same peer by helping them incorporate a flowchart into their project.

### Collaboration

I appreciated the opportunity to see other peers work, and be able to more formally collaborate with specific goals and desired outcomes. I tried to really hone in on the exact deliverables expected of the project and the feedback I provided aimed to give a specific, tangible benchmark for each of the issues I raised. For example, there was a slight discrepancy between some of the folder names, their contents, and the stated filepath structure in the ReadMe. I highlighted this so that the peer could update the names to ensure full accuracy between the different sections of the project.
