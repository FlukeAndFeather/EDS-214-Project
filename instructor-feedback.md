### Exceeds Spec

**NOTE:** Your two "exceeds" specs have to be in different learning objectives

#### The Student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review.

#### The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request.

I feel that the feedback I provided was detailed and concrete, which clearly communicated specific needs to get aspects of my peer's project to meet and exceed spec. This included the peer-assessment and the issues I created on Github. Also, I assisted the same peer by helping them incorporate a flowchart into their project.

### Collaboration

I appreciated the opportunity to see other peers work, and be able to more formally collaborate with specific goals and desired outcomes. I tried to really hone in on the exact deliverables expected of the project and the feedback I provided aimed to give a specific, tangible benchmark for each of the issues I raised. For example, there was a slight discrepancy between some of the folder names, their contents, and the stated filepath structure in the ReadMe. I highlighted this so that the peer could update the names to ensure full accuracy between the different sections of the project.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[NY] **The analysis produces the expected output**

-   Multiple plots, instead of one with multiple panels

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[NY] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

-   Your data processing scripts don't save any outputs

[NY] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

-   You should have a separate function in the R/ folder. This should be sourced in paper.qmd.

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[M] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[NY] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

-   You should have a script that installs the necessary packages for your analysis

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[E] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

-   Thank you for being thoughtful in your contributions to your peer's work!!

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[NY] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages

-   There's nothing in your docs/ folder, so there's nothing on GitHub Pages
