### Data

Relevant data from the above listed data package (Schaefer et. al) was utilized for this analysis. Specifically, since the goal of this project was only to replicate a single figure, the only relevant data-sets are the QuebradCuenca1-Bisley, QuebradaCuenca2-Bisley, QuebradCuenca3-Bisley, and RioMameyesPuenteRoto csv files. These were stored in the "data" repository of this project.
